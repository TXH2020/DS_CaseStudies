# Distributed Systems Case Studies

The objective of this project is to pick a series of distributed systems and analyze their salient aspects in order to obtain theoretical and practical knowledge of distributed systems.

Prior to this, I had taken up Blockchain course as part of college electives. Hence, I know some fundamentals about Raft, Paxos, BitCoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger etc.

I have experience of deploying Kafka with Zookeeper, running Kafka producers and consumers and also Kafka CLI. Exposure to Schema Registry. 

Deployed Cassandra. Ran CQL and also Python client. Connected Kafka to Cassaandra. Have connected Cassandra to Spark.

Have run MapRed programs in Hadoop, Pig and Spark. Also have an exposure to HBase. Have also experimented with Cloudera Data Platform and OpenStack.

The softwares chosen are as follows:

1. Ceph: Distributed Object Store. Ceph architecture, ceph client through librados python and ceph admin CLI, File vs Objects, CAP theorem, High Availability, Consistency Models(Linearizability, Serializability, Causal Consistency, Eventual Consistency), Ceph Papers Analysis(Ceph, CRUSH and RADOS), points related to bluestore and Ceph alternatives(Lustre and Gluster). 
2. Kafka: Distributed Message System. Kafka architecture and implementation choices. Message delivery semantics, pagecache, sendfile. Push vs pull. Points related to Optimistic Concurrency Control, Zookeeper deprecation, Consumer groups, and Kafka alternatives(Flink, Storm, Pulsar).  
3. Cassandra: Distributed Database
4. Spark: Distributed Analytics Engine + Miscellaneous topics
